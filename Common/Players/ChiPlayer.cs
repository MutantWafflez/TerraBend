    /// In more detail, Chi isn't quite like Mana for mages: there are some distinct differences. Each of the three "parts" of Chi have unique
    /// purposes. The player's current Chi value (<seealso cref="currentChi"/>) under normal circumstances is going to be whatever the Max Chi
    /// value is. However, the current Chi value, unlike Mana, will not be decreased by using normal bending moves; it can only be decreased by
    /// certain (enemy) attacks or one-time circumstances. The Current chi value regenerates VERY slowly, and has no "instant regen" method like
    /// mana/health potions. As for the Base Max Chi value (<seealso cref="baseMaxChi"/>) is the simplest of the three "parts", it's the saved,
    /// base max value of Chi. If the player's current Chi value falls below 50% of the base Max Chi, the player will be unable to use ANY bending
    /// moves until that threshold is passed again. Finally, the last "part" is the DISPLAYED max value (<seealso cref="displayedMaxChi"/>) of Chi;
    /// this value is reset to the base max Chi every tick, the current Chi value cannot pass this value. Some bending moves, as a side effect, will
    /// decrease this value (for example, summoning a persistent ball of flame). If the current Chi value falls below 70% of the DISPLAYED max chi
    /// value, then bending moves will lose 2% damage (additive) for each % below that threshold. For example, if the current Chi value is at 50% of
    /// the DISPLAYED max value, then bending moves will lose 40% damage.
