			LightningMove:
				'''
				In this move, a fire-bender generates an extremely deadly bolt of lightning that exits from the fingertips
				The bolt will instantly slay any non-boss entity (9% max life for boss entities) and then dissapate
				Lightning is extremely volatile and requires balance in order to be safely bended
				Attempting this move will backfire and instantly kill the bender unless Positive/Negative Jing are not within 5 Jing of each other
				If the bender is successful, all Positive/Negative Jing will be removed & replaced with Unaligned Jing
				'''

		ItemLore: {
			LightningMove:
				'''
				Scientifically speaking, lightning is an electrostatic discharge from one region (atmosphere, usually) to another (ground, usually) when said regions temporarily neutralize each other
				Lightning bolts in typical thunderstorms expel 1 Gigajoule (1,000,000,000 joules!) worth of energy, and thus are HIGHLY deadly if they strike someone
				These two facts form the basis of lightning-bending; bolts are formed through the transfer of different types of energy (roughly speaking) and are VERY deadly
				In (ATLA) canon, it has never been shown that an Avatar has been able to lightning-bend; only non-Avatars have used the ability
				Although in ATLA fire royals are the only ones shown to be able to bend lightning, in TLOK, non-royal fire-benders have (rarely) been shown to be able to learn the technique
